# cljs-starter

This is an unbelievable barebones starter for cljs projects.
This only exists because I don't use ClojureScript all that often, so whenever I come back to it I spend way too much time just to get a "hello world" type-thing going.
Hopefully this saves me some time in the future, and if it saves someone else's as well, that's great.

## Deps

You'll notice I added devtools and malli as a dependency. Devtools is basically self-explanatory; I use malli by default because my TypeScript brain can't handle not knowing the shape of things.

<sub><sup>
Note to self
If my future self reads this, remember you're a stupid bloke that can't use most Clojure libs, so just pull those npm libraries and use them directly - it should save some precious brain-CPU cycles.
